# Tarneeb Mobile
This is a mobile version of the card game [Tarneeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarneeb), with slightly different [rules](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/s9elm5j66cfzui3s2qrcq/Tarneeb-Rulebook.pdf?rlkey=2mrjxco0qnq0bue5q53nve8q4&dl=0).

**DISCLAIMER:** This project uses 3rd party assets from the Unity Asset Store (paid and free) that I have excluded from the project files. This does cause a lot of errors when loading the project in Unity.

**If you want to make changes to the project, you can grab the assets listed below and assign the missing references, or replace the used assets with your own and remove any Odin code**
